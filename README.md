# Investment Tracker PWA (v2)
Adds an **optional Start Date** (can be set in the past). If empty, it defaults to today.

Other features remain the same: reinvest cycles, mark cleared, CSV export with duration (months/weeks/days, using 1 month = 4 weeks), and full offline PWA.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

2. Upload all files at the repo root (keep `icons/` folder).
3. Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main` / root.
4. Open the Pages URL and "Add to Home Screen" on your phone.
